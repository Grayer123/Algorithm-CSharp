# 428. Serialize and Deserialize N-ary Tree
[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-n-ary-tree/)  

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.  

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize an N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.  



**Note:** 
1. N is in the range of [1, 1000]  
2. Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
